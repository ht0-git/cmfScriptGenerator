# Description
This script generates game scripts that can be used in the Total War: ROME REMASTERED modification, which allows you to control multiple game factions.

**Note:** Works correctly only if the modification does not have "Emerging Factions" (factions that have in the description "Events will be simulated leading up to the faction's appearance...").

# Usage
Place the faction list in the factions.txt file from the descr_strat.txt file with the required modification (from the "playable" and unlockable" category).

Run cmfScriptGenerator.py and it will create all the scripts that need to be placed in the folder next to descr_strat.txt.
